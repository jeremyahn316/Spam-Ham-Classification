# Spam-Ham-Classification

This project was created as a part of Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science using Python's Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries and Jupyter Notebook.

In this project, created a classifier that distinguishes spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails.

The main objective of this project is to work and understand: 

- Feature engineering with text data
- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
